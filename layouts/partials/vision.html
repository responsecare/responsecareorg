								<h3>Our vision is to rescue children and young people who are left vulnerable by
									poverty,
									especially children and young people in extreme poverty like those living in slums,
									in
									refugee resettlement camps or on the streets; those who are victims of forced work
									or of
									human trafficking.
									We want to see their lives transformed and taken out of poverty for good, by
									empowering
									and equipping them through the means of Art and Education.
								</h3>
								<h3>We are driven by a passion to see these children and young people integrate into
									society, one by one, equipped with the skills and talent to change their current
									circumstance, communities and break the cycle of poverty.</h3>
								<h3>Since then we have developed into a collective of passionate individuals from
									different
									walks of life driving forward Response Careâ€™s vision of making child poverty
									history.
