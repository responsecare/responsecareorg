								<h3>All our projects contribute to the eradication of child poverty, as we believe that young people have enormous potential and can grow beyond their individual circumstances.</h3>
								<h3>To achieve this goal, we work closely with local partners that align with our vision and mission.</h3>
								<h3>We equip our local partners with training and materials to support their communities with consistent education to vulnerable children and art resources and creative space to facilitate both their recovery from trauma and creative development.</h3>
								<h3>We recognise that there are many factors hindering the progress of the children we aspire to reach, or their access to educational and arts programmes. We aim to collaborate with other organisations to tackle the barriers, such as nutrition and shelter.</h3>
